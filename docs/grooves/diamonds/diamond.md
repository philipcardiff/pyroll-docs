# The `DiamondGroove` class

The `DiamondGroove` class represents a rhombus shaped groove as shown in the figure.

Mandatory measures of this groove are the two radii $`r_1`$ and $`r_2`$.
To constrain geometry fully, any two of the following must be given:
- usable width $`b_\mathrm{kn}`$
- tip depth $`d_\mathrm{t}`$
- tip angle $`\delta`$ 

So the constructor has the following signature:

    DiamondGroove(r1, r2, usable_width, tip_depth, tip_angle)

The radii are typically small, the depth is $`d_\mathrm{t}`$  typically $`< \frac{b_\mathrm{kn}}{2}`$ so that the tip angle $`\delta`$ is larger than 90Â°.

$`r_3`$ and $`r_4`$ are considered to be zero, as well as $`b_d`$ and $`b_d'`$.

The tip depth $`d_\mathrm{t}`$ was chosen in favor of the real depth $`d`$, because it does not change, when the radii are modified.
So the overall geometry remains the same if one modifies only the radii.
The tip depth can be considered as the diagonal of the rhombus with sharp corners.
