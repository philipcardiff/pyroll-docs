# Transport Units

```{py:currentmodule} pyroll.core
```

Transport are a multipurpose unit.
They can represent almost every processing step, which is characterized by negligible deformation but by thermal flows or microstructure evolution.
The most used application is the cooling in the clearances between every roll pass.
But, also furnaces or cooling ranges can be described by tarnsport units.
Transports are represented by the {py:class}`Transport` class.
