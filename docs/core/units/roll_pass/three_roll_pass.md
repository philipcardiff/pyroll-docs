# Three Roll Pass Units

```{py:currentmodule} pyroll.core
```

Nowadays, groove rolling in stands with 3 rolls aligned in 120째 angle gain more and more importance, especially for round rods and tubes.
PyRolL supports the simulation of three-roll rolling stands via the {py:class}`ThreeRollPass` class.
The {py:class}`ThreeRollPass` is derived from {py:class}`RollPass`, so hook functions defined for {py:class}`RollPass` also apply for three-roll passes, although they may not always be appropriate, but many are.
Always pay attention when simulating three-roll passes, that appropriate models are use, or the results may be heavily incorrect, which is not guaranteed to throw an error.

The main difference is that the dimensions of a three-roll pass are not right-angled, due to the 3-fold symmetry.
As the figure shows, the width and height are under an angle of odd multiples of 60째.
The caveat is, that width and height can not directly be measured here, but only their half.
This measure is implemented as hook functions for profiles featuring the type `"3fold"` (see [Profile Classifiers](../../profiles.md#profile-classifiers) for further information).

The width of ideal filling of the roll pass is here also dependent on the roll gap, as it is not for two-roll passes.
The width of ideal filling $w_{i=1}$ is given by the equation below, with the usable width of the groove $w_\mathrm{u}$ and the roll gap $s$.
As for two-roll passes the pass is always ideally filled, if no spreading resp. material flow model is loaded.

$$
w_{i=1} = \frac{w_\mathrm{u}}{\cos 30째} + s \tan 30째
$$

Dimensions of Three-Roll Passes
:::

For definition of a three-roll pass the same groove and roll objects as for two-roll passes are used.
The magic happens in {py:class}`ThreeRollPass.Roll` after creation of the instance.
So defining three-roll passes is straightforward.
Roll gap means the height of the clearing between the roll faces outside the actual groove hole, similar to two-roll passes.

```python
ThreeRollPass(
    label="My Three-Roll Pass",
    roll=Roll(
        groove=CircularOvalGroove(
            depth=8e-3,
            r1=6e-3,
            r2=40e-3
        ),
        nominal_radius=160e-3,
        rotational_frequency=1
    ),
    gap=2e-3,
),
```

Profiles originating from three-roll passes are marked with the special type classifier `"3fold"` (see [Profile Classifiers](../../profiles.md#profile-classifiers)), which indicated that the profile has a 3-fold symmetry instead of the common 2-fold symmetry of two-roll produced profiles.
