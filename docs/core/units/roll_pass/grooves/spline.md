# The Spline Groove

```{py:currentmodule} pyroll.core
```

For unusual groove types, one may define the shape directly as a linear spline curve by giving a sequence of $(y, z)$ points.
To classify the groove for the need of some model approaches, one must also provide a tuple of type classifiers (see [Profile Classifiers](../../../profiles.md#profile-classifiers)).
