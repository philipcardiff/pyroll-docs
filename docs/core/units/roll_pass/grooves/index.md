# Grooves

Currently, two basic approaches to the description of groove shapes exist in PyRolL.
The classic elongation groove shapes are derived from the [generic elongation groove](generic), which consists of several straights and radii.
For unusual shapes one may use the [spline groove](spline) to define the shape as a linear spline.

In the pages in the following index all groove types available in the core are described.
