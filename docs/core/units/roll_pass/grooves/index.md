# Grooves

Currently, two basic approaches to the description of groove shapes exist in PyRolL.
The classic elongation groove shapes are derived from the [generic elongation groove](generic), which consists of several straights and radii.
For unusual shapes one may use the [spline groove](spline) to define the shape as a linear spline.

In the pages in the following index all groove types available in the core are described.
Some groove constructors offer the possibility of choosing which parameters to give, the others are calculated automatically, if possible.
The documentation states which parameters must, and which may be given.
