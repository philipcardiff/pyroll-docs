# Roll Pass Units

```{py:currentmodule} pyroll.core
```

The roll pass is the most important unit, since forming of the workpiece is happening here.
It is represented by the {py:class}`RollPass` class.
The {py:class}`RollPass` constructor takes a {py:class}`Roll` object, which is defining the properties of the working rolls including the groove.

```{eval-rst} 
.. autoclass:: RollPass
    :members:
    :exclude-members: InProfile, OutProfile, Roll, Profile
```

```{eval-rst} 
.. autoclass:: Roll
    :members:
```
